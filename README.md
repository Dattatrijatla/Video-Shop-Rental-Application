**Video Shop Rental Application**

**Overview:**  
Developed a comprehensive video shop rental application using C#, ASP.Net MVC WebAPI, and Entity Framework. The application provides functionality for movie and customer record maintenance, along with transactional capabilities for renting and returning movies.

**Core Features:**  
1. **Movie Record Maintenance**: Allows for keeping track of all movies available and rented.
2. **Customer Record Maintenance**: Enables efficient management of customer details.
3. **Rental System**: Supports renting multiple movies in one transaction with header-detail views.
4. **Rental Return**: Facilitates the return of one or multiple rented movies simultaneously.

**Technical Specifics:**  
- Utilized the ASP.net MVC WebAPI to develop RESTful services.
- Adopted the code-second approach to ensure a clean separation between the database design and application development.
- Leveraged Fluent-API for database model mapping, avoiding the use of an EDMX file.
- Established the database using SSDT, demonstrating proficiency in designing and deploying schema changes.
- Demonstrated efficient data handling by loading and filtering over a million records seamlessly.
- Gained in-depth understanding and practical application of Pre and Post Deployment strategies using SQL and SSDT.

**Frontend Development:**  
- Employed Sencha ExtJS for the client-side UI development, incorporating the MVVM pattern and binding principles.
- Crafted maintenance screens for movies and customers.
- Designed transactional screens for the rental system, allowing multi-movie rentals and returns.
- Emphasized the usage of search screens, while avoiding form submits, autoLoad/autoSync, and the gridediting plugin.

**Research & Learning:**  
The project encompassed a deep dive into various technical areas, using resources such as:
- [ASP.Net MVC Web API RESTful service tutorial](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/webapi)
- [SQL SSDT Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt)
- [Guide on multiple post-deployment scripts with SQL Server project](https://medium.com/@desmond80in/multiplepost-deployment-scripts-with-sql-serverproject-5d3c9e2f52b4)

Additionally, through personal research, I delved into understanding the real-world application of Pre/Post Deployment, which aids in the seamless and efficient migration of database changes.

**Note:** Emphasis throughout the project was on showcasing creativity, introducing innovative ideas, and ensuring adherence to technical specifications.
